This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r setup libraries}
library(readr)
library(igraph)
library(statGraph)


```

```{r choose a file that is an ege CSV}
fname <- file.choose()
print(fname)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r read file}

input.df <- read_csv(fname)


```

```{r Create Graph}

Graph <- graph_from_data_frame(input.df)

```

```{r display Graphs}
plot(Graph)
plot(Graph, edge.arrow.size=.5, vertex.color="gold", vertex.size=15, 

     vertex.frame.color="gray", vertex.label.color="black", 

     vertex.label.cex=0.8, vertex.label.dist=2, edge.curved=0.2)

```

```{r Entropy of Graph}
A <- as.matrix(get.adjacency(Graph))
entropy <- graph.entropy(A)
print(entropy)
```
```{r page rank score}
sort(page.rank(graph=Graph)$vector)
```
```{r}
hub_score(Graph)
authority_score(Graph)
```
